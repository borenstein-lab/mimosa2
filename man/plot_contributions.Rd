\title{Plot species contributions for a single metabolite}
\usage{
plot_contributions(varShares, metabolite, metIDcol = "metID",
  include_zeros = F, include_residual = F, merge_threshold = 0.02,
  spec_threshold = 10, color_palette = NULL, order_spec = T,

}
\arguments{
\item{varShares}{Dataset of contributions}

\item{metabolite}{Compound to plot}

\item{include_zeros}{Whether to plot taxa that do not have any contribution}

\item{include_residual}{Whether to include the residual variation}

\item{merge_threshold}{Threshold at which low-contributing species are merged into "other"}

\item{spec_threshold}{Threshold number of minimum contributing species for merging into "other" to be applied}

\item{color_palette}{Color palette to use for taxa in plot}

\item{order_spec}{Whether to sort species by contribution size}

\item{taxa_max}{If this compound has more than this many contributing taxa, only this number will be plotted}
